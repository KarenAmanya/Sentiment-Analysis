# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
A sentiment analysis of a Kenyan bank using tweets. The tweets were sourced using the Twitter API and tweepy, a python library for accessing the twitter API.

### Objective 1:To find out the overall sentiment of the bank's customer's based on their tweets.

1. Irrelevant tweets accounted for the larger percentage, these are tweets meant for advertisemnt and advertisement purposes and were not specifically directed at the bank.
2. Negative tweets were the second larget group
3. Requests and inquiries came third, these are tweets requesting the bank admin to respond or questions regarding the banks services.
4. Positive tweets came last with suggestions which I had to exclude from the analysisas the model would not take in a category with only one observation.
